*Happy father's day*
You all have been the best father ever we could have asked for. 
Everything that you have done for us and how much ur care makes us love you fathers even more.
You always support us and believe in us, no matter what.
 We will always be ur little girls and boys, only growing into men and women that is blessed to have the best daddies in the world.
Daddies, you have always been someone we could look up to, you taught us right from wrong and to never give up when things get tough.
You have changed our lives and help us to become a better person, we love you and thank you for everything you have done for us.
Daddies we hope u won't mind me saying this but i just wanted to say thank you for everything, you are the best dad we could ever ask for, i hope that everything you've ever dreamed of comes true in every way
Everyone always say they have the best daddies in the world, but that can't be right. Because the men are right here with us. Cheers to the daddies in the house
We are so grateful for all your guidance and wisdom, u really are the best, thank you for acting like a kid when we need fun in our lives, being a friend when we need a shoulder to lean on and showing up as a parent when we need guidance, we don't know what we would do without you
Happy Father's day!!!
